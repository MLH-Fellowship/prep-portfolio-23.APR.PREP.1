about: I'm Kristin and I love creating things on the web. After graduating with a degree in Computer Science, I designed and developed webpages and emails for a homeless nonprofit, followed by a cancer treatment and research institution. I'm passionate about sustainability, mental health, and equality and diversity, and have always found fulfillment in using my technical skills to help others. To level up my skills, I attended The Grace Hopper Coding Bootcamp. Now, Iâ€™m ready to make a difference as a software engineer.
